# Image-Viewer-Using-Python-Tkinter
Hello there everyone,
This is simple image viewer that scrolls .jepg images forward and back. 

How to use:
1) Copy the path of the image from your system.
2) Add that path in the image widget in the code.
3) Run the program and enjoy.

Note:
There are 4 photos set in the code. This number is default number set by me and can be changed depending on the user's choice. 
To add more images, follow the following steps:
1)Add images to your main directory of the folder.
2)Use any names. It totally depends on you.
3)Make the new image widgets using the already existing image widgets( copy/paste widgets and change the directory of image.)
4)Add the image widget variable in the image list.
5)Enjoy your image viewer.
